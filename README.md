# Flower Image Classifier Project
#### Udacity-AWS AI Programming with Python Nanodegree
In this project, we delve into the exciting world of deep learning to tackle a specific task: classifying flowers. The project has been completed using Udacity's GPU-enabled workspace and it uses transfer learning to build a robust and efficient flower classification system using an image dataset having 102 flower categories.
Users are provided with the option to choose from three pre-trained models from PyTorch's Torchvision package- VGG19, AlexNet and DenseNet121
A new, untrained, feed-forward network architecture was defined as a classifier using ReLU activation functions. Dropout function was used to prevent overfitting of the model to the data. 
The code developed for the image classifier was then converted to command line applications train.py and predict.py in part 2 of the project
